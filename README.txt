ThinkD is a streaming algorithm for triangle counting in a fully dynamic graph stream with edge additions and deletions. 
ThinkD estimates the counts of global triangles and local triangles by making a single pass over the stream. 
ThinkD has the following advantages: 
- Accurate: ThinkD is up to 4.3X more accurate than its best competitors within the same memory budget
- Fast: ThinkD is up to 2.2X faster than its best competitors for the same accuracy requirements
- Theoretically Sound: ThinkD always maintains unbiased estimates
